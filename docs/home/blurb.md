**I am passionate about building technology that meaningfully benefits the physical world.** 

My focus areas are in robotics and control systems, and I am currently studying **Mechanical Engineering and Robotics** at **The Johns Hopkins University**. My interests lie in deep tech startups that leverage modern technologies like AI to improve the world we interact with. I've had internships at Zoox, Amazon's robotaxi spinoff, and Fulfil, a grocery automation startup, both of whom are aligned with this mission.

Born and raised in Central Jersey, I grew up in a melting pot of unique places, subcultures, and experiences, and became interested in how different aspects of the world around me could be improved by **implementing technology where it matters.** This has inspired me to build an equally diverse set of skills and interests, and continue taking in all the experiences the world has to offer.
