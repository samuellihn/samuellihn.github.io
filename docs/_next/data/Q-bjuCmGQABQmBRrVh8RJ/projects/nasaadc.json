In addition, processing the large 4-million-line data file into a piece of coherent terrain took many weeks, requiring me to dissect every step of the process to see had gone wrong.\\r\\nThis was a very rewarding app to create as it helped me understand and appreciate the math and code that goes into games that emulate the real world.\"\n      })]\n    });\n  }\n}\nreturn {\n  default: MDXContent\n};\n","frontmatter":{},"scope":{}},"thumbnail":"/projects/nasaadc/media/Rover-Driving-2.png","images":["/projects/nasaadc/media/Rover-Driving-1.png","/projects/nasaadc/media/Checkpoint.png","/projects/nasaadc/media/Destination-Site.png","/projects/nasaadc/media/Moonbase.png","/projects/nasaadc/media/Heatmap-1.png","/projects/nasaadc/media/Heatmap-2.png","/projects/nasaadc/media/Rover-Screenshot.png","/projects/nasaadc/media/Rover-Driving-2.png"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
