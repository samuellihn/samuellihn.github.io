Hi! I am a **Mechanical Engineering and Science** junior at **The Johns Hopkins University**. I'm passionate about solving hard problems in the robotics and deep tech fields and **integrating smarts** into traditional mechanical systems. My current interests lie in the areas of control systems engineering and data science. Most recently, I interned at **Zoox**, Amazon's robotaxi subsidiary, and 

Born and raised in Central Jersey, I grew up in a melting pot of unique places, subcultures, and experiences. I became interested in how different aspects of the world around me could be improved by **implementing technology where it matters.** This has inspired me to build an equally diverse set of skills and interests, and continue taking in all the experiences the world has to offer.
