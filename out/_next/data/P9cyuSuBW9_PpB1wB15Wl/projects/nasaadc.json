In addition, processing the large 4-million-line data file into a piece of coherent terrain took many weeks, requiring me to dissect every step of the process to see had gone wrong.\\r\\nThis was a very rewarding app to create as it helped me understand and appreciate the math and code that goes into games that emulate the real world.\"\n    })]\n  });\n}\nfunction MDXContent(props = {}) {\n  const {wrapper: MDXLayout} = {\n    ..._provideComponents(),\n    ...props.components\n  };\n  return MDXLayout ? _jsx(MDXLayout, {\n    ...props,\n    children: _jsx(_createMdxContent, {\n      ...props\n    })\n  }) : _createMdxContent(props);\n}\nreturn {\n  default: MDXContent\n};\n","frontmatter":{},"scope":{}},"thumbnail":"/projects/nasaadc/media/Rover-Driving-2.png","images":["/projects/nasaadc/media/Rover-Driving-1.png","/projects/nasaadc/media/Checkpoint.png","/projects/nasaadc/media/Destination-Site.png","/projects/nasaadc/media/Moonbase.png","/projects/nasaadc/media/Heatmap-1.png","/projects/nasaadc/media/Heatmap-2.png","/projects/nasaadc/media/Rover-Screenshot.png","/projects/nasaadc/media/Rover-Driving-2.png"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
